# Bibliographic Managers

Citation managers are an important tool for handling citations.
Nearly ever scholar today uses them, because they cut down on the time it takes to write, and make citations easier.
Done right, citation managers are an amazing tool that can save you hours of time.
Done wrong, you can waste time with citation managers downloading more and more citations into your citation manager, deceiving yourself into believing you are accomplishing work, when you are not.

There are many, many citation managers to choose from.
Pick whatever works for you.
Some of the more popular citation managers include:

## Microsoft Word

MS Word has a built in citation manager.
For convenience it is difficult to beat, but it is less functional than others.

## Zotero

Zotero is [free and works in your web-browser](https://www.zotero.org/).
It is a full-featured citation manager, and it is *free*.
This is also the citation manager that Sandy (SAASS' librarian) recommends, and you can use it to import Prof. Benson's citation list, which is also managed in Zotero.
As with MS Word, you can "Cite while you write" which means there is a Word Add-on, which will insert citation for you into a .docx document.
Zotero has a large community, with many tutorials I will not replicate here.

## JabRef

If you want to use LaTeX then [JabRef is the way to go](http://www.jabref.org/).
JabRef is also full featured, *free* and fully extensible as a database.
If there is information you want to track and there isn't a field in JabRef, you just add it.
JabRef stores all data in a .bib file, which is human readable, so you can manipulate or read it in a text editor if you want, which makes it especially good for taking notes in text.
It also is quite easy to share .bib files using standard sharing tools like Dropbox, GDrive or git.
The major drawback to JabRef is that it is made to work with LaTeX, not Word, so unless you are using LaTeX it isn't that helpful in generating bibliographies.

## Other managers

  * [EndNote](http://endnote.com/) - Lots of support since it is owned by Thompson Reuters, but costs money.
  * [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) - Formerly an open source competitor to Zotero, still free, though.
