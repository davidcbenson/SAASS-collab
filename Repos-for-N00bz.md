# How to Use Repo for N00bz

This repository (repo), as with any repository can either be used to as a git repository for people who want to interact with it, or as a webpage.
I suspect almost all students will treat this repository as a web page.
You can browse the repo exactly as a webpage, paying no attention whatsoever to the underlying technology.

If you want to us this repo to experiment with repositories I highly encourage it.
The simplest way to start is to download download the [github user interface][GitHubGui] for your platform.
Simply follow the instructions on the [github tutorial][GitHubGuiTutorial] to clone this repo, to your local machine.
If the only thing you can do with git is [commit][CommitHelp], [branch][BranchHelp], [checkout][CheckoutHelp] and [merge][MergeHelp] you will be well on your way to getting a lot out of git. (HINT: If you hate having 40 files each titles Thesis v 1.2, 1.3 etc. you'll love git.)
If these tutorials are insufficient, and want to try git, get with Prof. Benson and we will set something up.
Alternatively, [Software Carpentry][SoftwareCarpentry] offer [lessons][SoftwareCarpentryLessons] and [workshops][SoftwareCarpentryTutorials] that can be quite helpful.

Any changes you make or commit to your local machine *will not be visible* on the web unless, and until, you push the commit or send a pull request.
If you wish to experiment with remote (i.e. sharing files with git to other computers, like git is intended to do) then contact me and I will get you set up.
If you just want to contribute to this repo and know how git works, also just let me know.

You are best off, in life and in git, saving your text as a plaintext file, and not in a specific format like .doc/.docx.
Using text decreases file size, allows you to customize your interface as you like, and increases security, but most importantly git can really only meaningfully version control plaintext.
Of course, if you hate yourself, you can always open plaintext files in notepad, but if you don't have a preferred text editor, I recommend downloading and using the user-friendly [Atom][AtomDownload], if you do not already have a preferred text editor.
