# Library Managers

You will be getting a lot of books here at SAASS, and it can be easy to lose track of everything.
Online library managers can help with that.
Of course, you can just use your reference manager to manager your library, but as more and more articles creep into your manager, sorting through the books can become tedious.
Also, good library managers provide information automatically that a reference manager is not structured to handle.
Many library managers exist, but there are two more popular than others.

## GoodReads

[GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/) is the "readers" library manager.
While it can be used to manage a personal library, it is more focused on connecting people with new books to read, or other members with similar reading habits.
GoodReads is pretty good at many things that don't relate to research, per se, and can therefore be used to cultivate a habit of readership.

## LibraryThing

If GoodReads is for readers, [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/home) is for librarians.
LibraryThing takes the library part of library management very seriously, and is superior for tracking books you own, or would like to own.
This can be invaluable during moves or exams, when knowing where a book is can be crucial.
LibraryThing does have a large community, and makes suggestions and so forth, and can create interesting analytics of your library, but it is more interested in the books themselves.

Indicative of the focus on "library-like" services, is the additional service called "MiniCat" which allows you to have a searchable library available online.
You can even check out books to people, just like a library would.
This can be useful if you have people you lend books to, or if there is someone who you are working with who has a substantial library you would like to query to see what they have read on the subject.
