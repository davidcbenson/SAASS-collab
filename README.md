# SAASS Collaboration Repository (Repo)

To all who see these presents greetings.
This is an unofficial repository for students at SAASS, but if other people (especially those at other PMEs) find these tools or documents useful, then have at it.
No official information shall be posted here.
These are just public tools that anyone should be able to use.
Any SAASS faculty, student or alumnus is welcome to contribute, although realistically it will mostly be Prof. Benson, and a few others.
For the time being, there is *no code* in this repo, so don't expect anything to run, although that will likely change in the future.
The majority of what you will see in here are files related to research.

## How to Use a Repo

Repos are an important tool for collaboration and program development. Used properly git would help many other kinds of users, too. If you'd like to use this repo like computer programmers do, [check out some of the many helpful tools in that way.](Repos-for-N00bz.md) Otherwise, you can just treat it like a blog (which it is), a webpage (which it also is), or a wiki (which it also is).
